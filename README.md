# LATEST UPDATES - 4/16/2023 
### models.py, forms.py, views.py, urls.py, admin.py, settings.py have all been updated. Please update these files.
### I have also updated all the HTML files in the templates folder extensively, please update this folder 
### Also, notice that I have added 'static/db_connect/images' directory and then added an image file in there. This is also an update, but not required. I was just doing some testing with images.
### Then run 'python manage.py makemigrations' and python manage.py migrate' so that the changes in models.py can take affect in the database
### If you get any migration errors let me know. Usually when I get errors, I delete all tables in my instance and then try migrating again.
